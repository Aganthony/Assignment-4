# Exploring PyTest for Testing Exercises

Various demonstrations and examples of testing will be placed here.

## Consider installing black

Useful for code formatting management.

`pip install -U black --user`

## Data Structures

The example will explore two common data structures:
* [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_%28abstract_data_type%29)
* [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type))

The objective is to use [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/) to test their implementations.
